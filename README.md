# Language-Modeling-Text-Classification-and-Clustering-with-Machine-Learning

#### This project focuses on language modeling, text preprocessing, and classification using various machine learning algorithms. 
The workflow includes several key components:

## Text Preprocessing

Tokenization using NLTK
Stopword removal (including custom stopword lists)
Stemming with PorterStemmer
Punctuation and special  
character removal
Vectorization using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
## Supervised Learning for Text Classification

Implementing multiple classification models:
Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes (MNB)
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest Classifier
Model evaluation using cross-validation, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
## Unsupervised Learning for Text Clustering

K-Means Clustering to identify similar text groups
Dimensionality reduction using PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
Performance evaluation using clustering metrics like Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)
## Visualization & Performance Analysis

Data distribution and feature importance visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
Silhouette analysis for cluster validation
Word frequency distribution and TF-IDF feature analysis
This project demonstrates a comprehensive pipeline for text analysis and classification, leveraging machine learning techniques for effective language modeling.
 It is implemented in Python, using key libraries like NLTK, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
